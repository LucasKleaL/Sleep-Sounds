# Sleep Sounds 

### Sleep Sounds is a white noise reproduction application based on PWA (Progressive Web Application) functionality.

This application is fully based on front-end, the audio reproduction system is only based on native html/web tools. For this project I only use HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery and the standard requisites for PWA functions, like the JSON manifest.
